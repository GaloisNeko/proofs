* Proofs

  This is a collection of proof exercises I wrote.
  Currently I have collected examples from Isabelle and Coq.
  (might extend to Agda/Lean).

** Coq

   All proofs for Coq come from the book *Software Foundation*:

   1. Logical Foundation
      - [X] Basics
      - [X] Induction
      - [X] Lists
      - [X] Poly
      - [X] Tactics
      - [X] Logic
      - [ ] IndProp (a bit too long...will look back later)
      - [ ] Maps
   2. Programming Language Foundations...
   3. Verified Functional Algorithms
   4. Quickchick
   5. Verifiable C

** Isabelle

   Some random assignments.
