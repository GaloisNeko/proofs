* Proofs

  This is a collection of proof exercises I wrote.
  Currently I have collected examples from Isabelle and Coq.
  (might extend to Agda/Lean).

** Coq

   All proofs for Coq come from the book *Software Foundation*:

   1. Logical Foundation

      - [X] Induction
      - [X] Lists

      - [ ] IndProp (almost)
      - [X] Map
      - [X] ProofObjects
      - [X] IndPrinciples
      - [X] Rel
      - [ ] Imp (almost)
      - [X] ImpParser
      - [X] ImpCEvalFun
      - [X] Extraction
      - [X] Auto
      - [X] AltAuto
   2. Programming Language Foundations
      - [ ] Equiv
   3. Verified Functional Algorithms
   4. Quickchick

** Isabelle

   Some random assignments.
